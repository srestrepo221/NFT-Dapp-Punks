# dapp_punks NFT

This project demonstrates an NFT contract. It comes with a minting contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

This project inherits from an OpenZeppelin library for security and ease. The NFT smart contract is built with Solidity, tested with JavaScript, and rendered via React.

Project features:
